    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Family heirloom pancakes ... Chuck, James, Maximilian, and now Bekah's
      modifications, too.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups Flour</li>
      <li>8 tsp Calumet Baking Powder</li>
      <li>
        3.5 Tbsp Sugar or Honey (requires a smidge more than 3.5T, but is good
        for color)
      </li>
      <li>1 tsp Cinnamon and/or Vanilla (optional)</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
      <li>4 cups Milk, or 4 cups Buttermilk + 1/2 cup Milk</li>
      <li>
        4-5 cups Apples, Blueberries, Bananas, Chopped Nuts, or anything else
        you want in your pancakes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat eggs first. Blend in oil. Next mix in milk and then apples (or
        other additions)
      </li>
      <li>Sift dry ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Fold liquid with apples into flour mix. Stir just to mix. Do not overmix
        because it makes the pancakes rubbery.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let sit for 5 minutes or so before spooning out. Break any remaining
        lumps with the back of the spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pre-heat heavy pan to 350-375 (water drops dance). Season pan if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop from long-handled serving spoon. Turn when sides skinned over and
        most of the bubbles pop. Peek under edge. If too light, raise heat. If
        too dark, lower heat. (1/2 number settings on electric stove, or 25
        degrees on skillet.)
      </li>
      <li>Cool on rack - they will get soggy if stacked too soon.</li>
      <li>
        Freeze leftovers in pairs in ziploc bags. Pop frozen into toaster on
        light setting or frozen into microwave for 30 seconds. Reheat 20 seconds
        if thawed.
      </li>
    </ol>
